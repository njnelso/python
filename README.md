# WELCOME TO PYTHON
* This is your first REPLIT project. Take some time to acquaint yourself.


* In the far left column, called "Files", you will find a file called **main.py**. This is the python script you will be writing. If you don't see this colun, click the file icon at the top of the bar on the left.


* In the middle column, called "README.md", you will see a markdown file. This file is then parsed and turned into a pretty, formatted document that you can "Preview" in the right column. *(If you don't see the preview on the right, just toggle the "Preview" button in the upper-right corner of this column)* 


* If you have toggled the preview button, but still don't see the formatted preview, be sure to click the "Markdown" tab at the top of the right column.


* **Pro Tip:** drag the bar between the README.md column in the middle and the "Markdown" column on the right over to the left to see more of the preview.

## Working with print():

* The `print()` method can print out comma separated parameters that are passed to it between parentheses:
  
  &nbsp;
  * `print("hello", "how", "are", "you?")`
  
  &nbsp;
  * The line above will print out: `"hello how are you?"`

&nbsp;
## Working with Variables:

* You can create a variable by placing the name you want to reference it by on the left, the value you want to assign to it on the right and a single equals sign in between.
  
  &nbsp;
  * `var_name = "Some value here!"`


* This variable can be referred to as if it were it's assigned value:
  
  &nbsp;
  * `print("The variable named var_name contains the value: ", var_name)`
  
  &nbsp;
  * The above line would print out: `The variable named var_name contains the value: Some value here!`

&nbsp;
## Working with Strings (str):
* Strings, or str literals come between single or double quotes:

  &nbsp;
  * `'I am a str'`
  
  &nbsp;
  * `"me too"`


* Strings can be combined *(concatenated)* by placing a plus sign between them:

  &nbsp;
  * `"I am a str" + 'me too'`

  &nbsp;
  * The above combined *(concatenated)* string would evaluate to: `"I am a strme too"`


* Notice the output above, and that our strings got smashed together. We should add a space in between them to help with readability. 

  &nbsp;
  * `'I am a str' + ' ' + "me too"`

  &nbsp;
  * The above combined *(concatenated)* string would evaluate to: `"I'm a str me too"`

## Getting Started:
When you are ready to move on, check out the **main.py** file in the left column. If you don't see the left column, click the file icon at the top of the left bar.
