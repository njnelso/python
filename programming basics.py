# Welcome to the main.py file. We will use this file for most of our work in REPLIT.

# Note the hashtag (#) symbol at the front of a line indictes that it is a comment.

# Comments are for humans, and will be skipped by the python interpreter.

# As we progress through the Python section, we will learn new concepts and build upon them.

# When you code in REPLIT, you will write your code in between comments that look like this:

### YOUR CODE STARTS HERE ###

### YOUR CODE ENDS HERE ###

# When you are ready to test your code, click the checkmark in the left bar and click "Run tests". They are named for the corresponding problem.

# Once you have passed all the tests, click the submit button in the upper right corner

# IMPORTANT: DO NOT EDIT ANY OTHER CODE OR COMMENTS ON THIS PAGE

# Time to get started... good luck and have fun!

'''Q1. Hello World'''

# Print out the string 'Hello World!'

### YOUR CODE STARTS HERE ###

print("Hello World!")

### YOUR CODE ENDS HERE ###

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------- #
'''Q2. Create a Variable - (No test cases for this)'''

# Create a variable called name, and assign it to the value of your first name.

### YOUR CODE STARTS HERE ###

name = "Nick"

### YOUR CODE ENDS HERE ###

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------- #
'''Q3. Name String'''

# Use concatenation, and the name variable you declared in problem 2 above to print out the phrase: 'My name is <NAME> and I will be a Python Master!'

### YOUR CODE STARTS HERE ###

print("My name is " + name + " and I will be a Python Master!")
