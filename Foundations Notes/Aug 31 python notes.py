# Review from yesterday
# numbers (int)
# words (strings)
# operators (+, -, *, /, //, %, **)
# print() - prints to console
# type() - tells the datatype
# type casting - str()
# variables and variable names
# Reviewing basing math:
print(5 + 5)
# We can also do math with variables:
num1 = 100
num2 = 25
print(num1 + num2)
print('Ryan' * num2)
# same goes with string types
str1 = 'banana'
str2 = 'pancakes'
print(str1 + ' ' + str2)
print(str1 + str2)
# lets chat a little about modulation
# % gives the remainder ... we will often use it to determine even/odd (modulate by 2)
a = 5
b = 4
c = 150 + 277 - 13 // 6
print(c)
print(c % 2)
# Other datatypes we have not learned about yet
# Boolean - True or False (one, off) (is, isn't)
name = True
print(type(name))
# Truthy v Falsy
# what is Truthy?
# any number that is NOT 0
# any string that contains at least one character (even a space)
# what is Falsy?
# 0 is Falsy
# empty strings are Falsy '' (empty strings are NOT ' ')
# lets chat about float point numbers (floats)
# integers are whole numbers: 0, 100, -5, 1000
# floats are any number in between these ints: 5.5, -0.234, 99.9
print(int(25 / 5))
my_num = 25 / 5
print(int(my_num))
print(25 // 5)
